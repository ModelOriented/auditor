\title{Automated tests for model residuals

Currently three tests are performed
 - for outliers in residuals
 - for autocorrelation in target variable or in residuals
 - for trend in residuals as a function of target variable (detection of bias)}
\usage{
check_residuals(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class 'explainer' created with function \code{\link[DALEX]{explain}} from the DALEX package.}

\item{...}{other parameters that will be passed to further functions.}
}
\value{
list with statistics for particular checks
